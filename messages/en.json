  "About": {
    "code": "Back in my early days, I started exploring development by creating small projects and quickly became captivated by the endless possibilities of coding. Over the years, I‚Äôve had the privilege to work as a software engineer, and eventually, I co-founded <sniivelink>Sniive</sniivelink>, where I served as CTO, developing solutions to streamline knowledge transfer in teams. Previously, I've worked on innovative projects at places like <cedelink>CEDE Labs</cedelink> and <wanderlink>Wandercraft</wanderlink>, always aiming to build software that merges robust functionality with intuitive design.",
    "other": "My focus today is on crafting elegant architectures that enhance user experience while supporting complex data-driven applications. When I'm not deep in code, I'm either making or listening to <spotilink>music</spotilink>, refining my playlists, or exploring the latest trends in tech and AI."
